# Machine-Learning-Project--Regression_Algoritham.-Data-science-Car_price
# Project Overview
This project assists a Chinese automobile company in entering the U.S. market by analyzing factors influencing car prices. Using a dataset of car specifications and prices, the objective is to build predictive models and identify key variables affecting pricing. The insights gained will guide strategic decisions regarding car design, pricing, and market positioning.
# Objectives
Identify the key variables significantly affecting car prices.
Develop and compare regression models to predict car prices.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
# Data Preprocessing
Addressed missing values and cleaned the dataset.
Encoded categorical variables for analysis.
Scaled numerical features to standardize the data.
# Regression Models Implemented
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
# Model Evaluation
Compared model performance using key metrics:
  R-squared
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
Selected the best-performing model for future predictions.
